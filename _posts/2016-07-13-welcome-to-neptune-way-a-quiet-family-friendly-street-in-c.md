Welcome to Neptune Way, a quiet, family friendly street in Comox close to parks, schools and shopping.

2277A Neptune Way has a lot to offer. With a double garage and a 3rd gravel side yard parking space (for trailer/boat parking) there is plenty of room to park and store your tools, toys and vehicles.

Enter through the craftsman style front door into your tiled foyer and put your coat and shoes away in the large entrance closet. Then head upstairs to the main living area, comprised of a spacious living room, dining room and kitchen arranged in an open concept layout. Dark and durable laminate floors and tile in the kitchen make upkeep easy and look great.
