  French doors open off the dining area onto a large deck with views over the
  neighbourhood and forest areas to the north and west, with partial mountain
  views west and sunsets during the summer over Mt. Washington. The deck is
  about 200 sq. ft. and can easily fit a BBQ and full patio set, and is shaded
  from the hot summer sun for perfect outdoor summer dining.
